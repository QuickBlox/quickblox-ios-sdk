Enable the AI Assist Answer feature:
```swift
QuickBloxUIKit.feature.ai.answerAssist.enable = true
```

If enabled, a button will appear next to each incoming message in the chat interface.

When the button is clicked, the Assist Answer feature will be launched, and a response will be generated based on the chat history.

Set up the AI settings by providing either the OpenAI API key:

```swift
QuickBloxUIKit.feature.ai.answerAssist.apiKey = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

Or set up with a proxy server:

```swift
QuickBloxUIKit.feature.ai.answerAssist.serverPath = "https://your-proxy-server-url"
```

A developer using the AI Answer Assist library has the ability use to Default AIAnswerAssistSettings.

```swift
public class AIAnswerAssistSettings {
    /// Determines if assist answer functionality is enabled.
    public var enable: Bool = true
    
    /// The OpenAI API key for direct API requests (if not using a proxy server).
    public var apiKey: String = ""
    
    /// The URL path of the proxy server for more secure communication (if not using the API key directly).
    /// [QuickBlox AI Assistant Proxy Server](https://github.com/QuickBlox/qb-ai-assistant-proxy-server).
    public var serverPath: String = ""
    
    /// Represents the available API versions for OpenAI.
    public var apiVersion: QBAIAnswerAssistant.APIVersion = .v1
    
    /// Optional organization information for OpenAI requests.
    public var organization: String? = nil
    
    /// Represents the available GPT models for OpenAI.
    public var model: QBAIAnswerAssistant.Model = .gpt3_5_turbo
    
    /// The temperature setting for generating responses (higher values make output more random).
    public var temperature: Float = 0.5
    
    /// The maximum number of tokens to generate in the request.
    public var maxRequestTokens: Int = 3000
    
    /// The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.
    public var maxResponseTokens: Int? = nil
}
```

A developer using the AI Answer Assist library has the ability to setup custom settings. This is an example of creating custom tones and installing them in QuickBlox iOS UI Kit from the custom application.

```swift
import QBAIAnswerAssistant

// Setup custom settings for QBAIAnswerAssistant.
QuickBloxUIKit.feature.ai.answerAssist.organization = "CustomDev"
QuickBloxUIKit.feature.ai.answerAssist.model = .gpt4
QuickBloxUIKit.feature.ai.answerAssist.temperature = 0.8
QuickBloxUIKit.feature.ai.answerAssist.maxRequestTokens = 3500
```

## OpenAI

To use the OpenAI API and generate answers, you need to obtain an API key from OpenAI. Follow these steps to get your API key:

1. Go to the [OpenAI website](https://openai.com) and sign in to your account or create a new one.
2. Navigate to the [API](https://platform.openai.com/signup) section and sign up for access to the API.
3. Once approved, you will receive your [API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), which you can use to make requests to the OpenAI API.

## Proxy Server

Using a proxy server like the [QuickBlox AI Assistant Proxy Server](https://github.com/QuickBlox/qb-ai-assistant-proxy-server) offers significant benefits in terms of security and functionality:

Enhanced Security:
- When making direct requests to the OpenAI API from the client-side, sensitive information like API keys may be exposed. By using a proxy server, the API keys are securely stored on the server-side, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or potential breaches.
- The proxy server can implement access control mechanisms, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users with valid QuickBlox user tokens can access the OpenAI API. This adds an extra layer of security to the communication.

Protection of API Keys:
- Exposing API keys on the client-side could lead to misuse, abuse, or accidental exposure. A proxy server hides these keys from the client, mitigating the risk of API key exposure.
- Even if an attacker gains access to the client-side code, they cannot directly obtain the API keys, as they are kept confidential on the server.

Rate Limiting and Throttling:
- The proxy server can enforce rate limiting and throttling to control the number of requests made to the OpenAI API. This helps in complying with API usage policies and prevents excessive usage that might lead to temporary or permanent suspension of API access.

Request Logging and Monitoring:
- By using a proxy server, requests to the OpenAI API can be logged and monitored for auditing and debugging purposes. This provides insights into API usage patterns and helps detect any suspicious activities.

Flexibility and Customization:
- The proxy server acts as an intermediary, allowing developers to introduce custom functionalities, such as response caching, request modification, or adding custom headers. These customizations can be implemented without affecting the client-side code.

SSL/TLS Encryption:
- The proxy server can enforce SSL/TLS encryption for data transmission between the client and the server. This ensures that data remains encrypted and secure during communication.
