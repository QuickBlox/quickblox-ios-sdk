You have an ability to sell content via your internal currency, inApp purchases or provide via subscription model. We use price points for selling our content. Currently we have A, B and C price points. We use A to mark FREE content and B/C for the paid content. Basically B is equal to 0.99$ and C equal to 1.99$ but the actual price can be vary depend on the countries and others circumstances.


To sell content via inApp purchases, you have to create products for B and C content at your iTunes Connect developer console and then set ids to sdk

### In-app purchase product identifiers 

```objc
   [STKStickersManager setPriceBProductId:@"com.priceB.example"         andPriceCProductId:@"com.priceC.example"];
```
To sell content via internal currency, you have to set your prices to sdk. This price labels will be showed at stickers shop, values you will received at callback from shop.


### Internal currency

 ```objc
    [STKStickersManager setPriceBWithLabel:@"0.99 USD" andValue:0.99f];
    [STKStickersManager setPriceCwithLabel:@"1.99 USD" andValue:1.99f];
```

 When your purchase was failed you have to call failed method:
 ```objc
 [[STKStickersPurchaseService sharedInstance] purchaseFailedError:error];
 ```
### Subscription 
If you want to use subscription model, you need to set subscription flag to sdk, when user became or ceased to be subscriber(or premium user). After this, content with B price point be available for free for subscribers(premium users)

- (void)purchasePack:(NSNotification *)notification {
    packName = notification.userInfo[@"packName"];
    packPrice = notification.userInfo[@"packPrice"];
}
 ```
  When your purchase was succeeded you have to call success method:
 ```objc
 [[STKStickersPurchaseService sharedInstance] purchasInternalPackName:packName andPackPrice:packPrice];
 ```
