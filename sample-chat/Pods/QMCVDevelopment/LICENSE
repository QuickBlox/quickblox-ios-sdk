Q-municate Contributor License Agreement, Version 1.0, July 2014.
You and QuickBlox hereby accept and agree to the following terms and conditions:

1.      Contributors and Contributions

1.1     Any individual or legal entity that voluntarily submits to the Project a
Contribution is addressed herein as "Contributor" or "You". A "Quality
Contributor" is an individual or legal entity that makes Contributions relating
to bug reports, bug fixes, test cases and other quality attributes of the
Project’s existing software. For legal entities, the entity making a
Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are
under common control with that entity are considered to be a single
Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means

(a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or

(b) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or

(c) beneficial ownership of such entity.

1.2     A "Contribution" is any original work, including any modification or
addition to an existing work that has been submitted for inclusion in, or
documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by the Project, where
such work originates from that particular Contributor.

1.3     A Contribution is "submitted" when any form of electronic, verbal, or
written communication or documentation sent to the Project (including but not
limited to communication via email to QuickBlox or committing code into the 
repositories of the project maintained by QuickBlox).

1.4.    Any Contribution submitted by You to the Project shall be under the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, without any additional terms or
conditions. In the event QuickBlox should request that You execute this Agreement in
written form with a personal signature, or execute a form of assignment or other
documents necessary to complete a copyright registration filing, You agree to do
so promptly and without additional consideration.

2.      Contributor Grants.
For the benefit of QuickBlox:
2.1     You hereby irrevocably assign, transfer, and convey to QuickBlox all right,
title and interest in and to the Contribution. Such assignment includes all
copyrights, copyright applications, and copyright registrations, and all other
intellectual property or proprietary rights other than patents relating to the
Contribution, together with all causes of actions accrued in your favor for
infringement thereof, recognized in any jurisdiction, whether or not perfected
("Proprietary Rights"). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, QuickBlox
shall have the right to use or not use the Contribution and to use, sell,
register, distribute, license, reproduce, re-use, alter, modify, edit, change,
or otherwise commercialize the Contribution as it sees fit, in any manner now
known or in the future discovered, and for any purpose. To the extent that
under any applicable mandatory law, Proprietary Rights cannot be assigned, You
irrevocably agree to grant, and You hereby grant, to QuickBlox an exclusive,
perpetual, irrevocable, unlimited, worldwide, fully paid, and unconditional
license to use and commercialize Proprietary Right to the Contribution in any
manner now known or in the future discovered. To the extent such license grant
is not fully valid, effective or enforceable under mandatory law, You
irrevocably agree to grant, and You hereby grant, to QuickBlox, such rights as
QuickBlox reasonably requests in order to acquire a legal position as close as
possible to full and exclusive legal ownership.
2.2     You hereby grant to QuickBlox and to and to any and all individuals and
entities who obtain, access, use, or distribute any QuickBlox product a perpetual,
non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty free, irrevocable (except as
set forth below with respect to litigation) license to any patent rights to
make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise exploit or
transfer your Contribution or prepare derivative works thereof, where such
license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are
necessarily infringed by your Contribution alone or by combination of your
Contribution with other work of the Project. The patent license granted in this
Section shall immediately terminate with respect to any party that institutes
patent litigation against You or QuickBlox (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Project work to which You
have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement.
2.3     Upon making the assignment and grants set forth in Section 2.1, You shall
receive from QuickBlox a non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty-free,
irrevocable license to make, have made, use, reproduce, distribute,
sub-license, modify and prepare derivative works based on your Contribution.
2.4     In case that under mandatory law, You retain any moral rights or other
inalienable rights to Contributions, You agree not to exercise such rights,
until You have provided prior written notice to QuickBlox and then only in
accordance with any reasonable instructions that QuickBlox issues in the interest
of protecting its rights and the rights of its users and customers.
2.5     In order to ensure that QuickBlox will be able to acquire, perfect and use
its Proprietary Rights under Section 2.1 and its patent license under Section
2.2, You will: (i) sign any documents to assist QuickBlox in the documentation,
perfection and enforcement of its rights, and (ii) provide QuickBlox with support
and reasonable access to information for recording, perfecting, securing,
defending, and enforcing its rights. You also irrevocably authorize QuickBlox to
act and sign on your behalf and take any necessary steps in order to perfect
QuickBlox’s rights under this Agreement.

3.      Identification of Contributors
3.1     Upon general availability release of a QuickBlox product that includes your
Contribution, QuickBlox shall identify You by name in the acknowledgements section
of the code notes.  QuickBlox's sole liability and your sole remedy for breach of
this Section is for QuickBlox to correct the attribution in the next release
following the date on which the breach was brought to QuickBlox's attention. Any 
Contributor who does not want to be identified as a Contributor must notify
QuickBlox of that by means of an email to community@quickblox.com.

4.      Contributor Representations.
With acknowledgement and agreement that QuickBlox and Users of its products will 
invest significant resources in product development, application development, 
marketing, and other cost-intensive undertakings in reliance upon your 
representations in this Agreement, You represent and warrant that:
4.1     You are legally entitled to grant the above assignment and license.
4.2     If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create
that includes your Contributions, You have received permission to make
Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such
rights for your Contributions to the Project, or that your employer has executed
a separate CLA with QuickBlox.
4.3     Each of your Contributions is your original creation. You represent that
any Contribution submission(s) You make shall include full disclosure and
complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but
not limited to, related copyright, patents and trademarks) which are associated
with any part of your Contribution.
4.4     To the best of your knowledge, no government license or permission is
required for the export, import, transfer or use of the Contribution.
4.5     No claim or dispute has been alleged, threatened, made or filed in
connection with the ownership, use or distribution of your Contribution.
4.6     Entering into this Agreement and submitting a Contribution does not
violate, breach or constitute a default under any other agreement to which You
or your employer is a party, does not require any consent, approval or waiver
from or notice to any third party, and does not violate any law or regulation.
5.      Contributor's Ongoing Obligation.
You agree to notify the Project promptly of any facts or circumstances of which
You become aware that would make the representations and warranties in Section 4
inaccurate or untrue in any respect.
6.      Disclaimer of Warranties.
EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN SECTION 4, NEITHER YOU NOR QUICKBLOX
MAKE ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND TO THE OTHER PARTY, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTIES OF A CONTRIBUTION'S MERCHANTABILITY
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7.      Support for Contributions.
You are not expected or obligated to provide technical support for your
Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide such support. You may
provide technical support for free, for a fee, or not at all.  If You decide to
provide technical support for a fee, QuickBlox shall have no obligation to pay any
such fee unless the terms of such support (including applicable fees) are set
forth in a separate written agreement signed by an authorized representative of
QuickBlox.

8.      Acceptance and Compensation.
8.1     The Project is under no obligation to accept any Contribution or include
any Contribution in any Project software or documentation. 
8.2 The compensation for Quality Contributors (ie bug reports, test cases, bug
patches) shall be defined in the Quality Contributor Program pages at
QuickBlox website, which QuickBlox reserves the right to change from time to time 
effective upon updating the relevant web pages. The compensation you receive for a 
Contribution given pursuant to the Quality Contributor Program will be determined 
based upon the compensation in effect on the date your Contribution was received.

8.3     For any Contribution from You that QuickBlox accepts and, in its reasonable 
discretion, decides is of material value to the Project (i.e. feature
contributions that significantly extend or improve the functionality of Project
software), QuickBlox, or its community of users, You shall have the right to
receive as consideration for your Contribution any two of the following items:
(a) a discount of US $100 off the applicable fee for subscribing to a paid QuickBlox

(b) a QuickBlox branded t-shirt

8.4     Do not submit a Contribution if the compensation set forth in this Agreement 
is not acceptable to you. Instead contact QuickBlox at community@quickblox.com with 
a complete description of the contribution you are prepared to make and a summary of
the business terms on which the contribution could be made. From time to time QuickBlox will make
extraordinary compensation available for a Contribution that provides
extraordinary benefit to the Project.

8.5     For a conclusive determination of whether your Contribution gives rise
to a right to such consideration You may contact the Project at:
community@quickblox.com. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE CONSIDERATION YOU ELECT TO 
RECEIVE PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION 8 IS THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE COMPENSATION YOU WILL EVER 
RECEIVE IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR CONTRIBUTION AND YOUR OBLIGATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

9.      Future Claims.
At no time hereafter shall You dispute, contest, or aid or assist others in
disputing or contesting, either directly or indirectly, QuickBlox's exclusive right,

relating to its subject matter.  The terms of this Agreement are binding contractual 
obligations and not mere guidelines or recitals.  The "License
