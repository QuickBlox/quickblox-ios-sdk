If You comply with this agreement, You have the rights below.
 
(1) USE OF THE SDK. Subject to Your compliance with this agreement, QuickBlox hereby authorizes You to use the SDK solely for the purpose of creating mobile applications designed to operate with the Services (referred to as "Authorized Applications"). You may not rent, lease or lend any of Your rights in the SDK or access to the Services. You may make a reasonable number of copies of the SDK for the purposes set forth herein, provided that You reproduce only complete copies, including without limitation all "read me" files, copyright notices, and other legal notices and terms that QuickBlox has included in the SDK.
 
(2) SCOPE OF LICENSE. The SDK is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives You some rights to use the SDK. QuickBlox specifically does not grant any express or implied rights under its patents with respect to your Authorized Applications.

You may not: (a) reverse engineer, decompile, distribute or disassemble the SDK, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits; or (b) make more copies of the SDK than specified in this agreement, except and only to the extent applicable law expressly permits; or (c) publish the SDK for others to copy; or (d) rent, lease or lend the SDK.
 
(3) USE OF THE SERVICES. Your use of the Services, and the use of the Services by anyone hosting or using your Authorized Application, is governed by the then-current Terms of Services (“TOS”) which can be found at: https://quickblox.com/terms-of-service.

(6) TERMINATION. QuickBlox reserves the right to discontinue offering the SDK or Services or to modify the SDK or Services at any time in its sole discretion. This Section and Sections 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 will survive termination of this agreement or any discontinuation of the offering of the SDK or Services along with any other provisions that would reasonably be deemed to survive such events.
 
(7) RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. You are not authorized to alter, modify, copy, edit, format, create derivative works of or otherwise use any materials, content or technology provided under this agreement except as explicitly provided in this agreement or approved in advance in writing by QuickBlox.
 
(8) MODIFICATIONS; NOTICES. If we change this contract, then we will give you notice before the change is in force. If you do not agree to these changes, then you must cancel and stop using the SDK and Services before the changes are in force. If you do not stop using the SDK or Services, then your use of the SDK or Services will continue under the changed contract. QuickBlox may give notices to You, at QuickBlox's option, by posting on any portion of quickblox.com or by electronic mail to any e-mail address provided by You to QuickBlox.
 
(9) ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and any applicable TOS or contract for Services, are the entire agreement with respect to the SDK or Services.
 
(10) APPLICABLE LAW AND VENUE. This agreement and any disputes or claims arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) are governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of England. The parties irrevocably agree that the courts of England have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with this Agreement or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims).
 
(11) DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The SDK is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using it. QuickBlox gives no express or implied warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights under Your local laws which this agreement cannot change. To the extent permitted under Your local laws, QuickBlox excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. QuickBlox does not represent or warrant that the SDK or the Services will always be available, uninterrupted, secure, or error free.
 
(12) LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. In no event will QuickBlox or its licensors be liable for the following, regardless of the theory of liability or whether arising out of the use or inability to use the QuickBlox SDK or otherwise, even if a party been advised of the possibility of such damages: (a) indirect, incidental, exemplary, special or consequential damages; (b) loss or corruption of data or interrupted or loss of business; or (c) loss of revenue, profits, goodwill or anticipated sales or savings. QuickBlox, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, suppliers and licensors collectively, shall have no liability to the Licensee whatsoever, whether based in warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise.
