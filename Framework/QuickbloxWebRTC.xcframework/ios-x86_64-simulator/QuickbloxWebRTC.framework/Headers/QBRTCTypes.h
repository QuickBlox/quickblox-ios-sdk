 *  - QBRTCConnectionUnknown: connection state is unknown; this can occur when non of the others states are fit for the current situation

 *  - QBRTCConnectionPending: connection is in pending state for other actions to occur
 *  - QBRTCConnectionConnecting: one or more of the ICE transports are currently in the process of establishing a connection
 *  - QBRTCConnectionChecking: the ICE agent has been given one or more remote candidates and is checking pairs of local and remote candidates against one another to try to find a compatible match, but has not yet found a pair which will allow the peer connection to be made; it's possible that gathering of candidates is also still underway
 *  - QBRTCConnectionConnected: connection was performed successfully
 *  - QBRTCConnectionDisconnected:  disconnected, but not closed; can still be reconnected
 *  - QBRTCConnectionClosed: connection was closed
 *  - QBRTCConnectionCount: ICE connection reached max numbers
 *  - QBRTCConnectionDisconnectTimeout: connection was disconnected by timeout
 *  - QBRTCConnectionNoAnswer: connection did not receive answer from the opponent user
 *  - QBRTCConnectionRejected: connection was rejected by the opponent user
 *  - QBRTCConnectionHangUp: connection was hanged up by the opponent user
 *  - QBRTCConnectionFailed: one or more of the ICE transports on the connection is in the failed state; this can occur on the different circumstances, e.g. bad network etc.
